    "The rust ecosystem is vast, and rather scary. Lets go over the tools, files, and other important things that are useful to know:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**rustc** - The rust compiler. Usually you don't run this command on it's own, rather **cargo** runs it.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**cargo** - Cargo, the helper for everything Rust. You can build projects using cargo, install dependencies, and even install addons to the Cargo CLI.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**[crates.io](https://crates.io)** - The place where all dependencies are stored. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Cargo.toml** - A manifest file, containing all information for the project. For example, `version`, `authors` and `dependencies`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**target** - A directory containing built code of dependencies and your project.\r\n",
