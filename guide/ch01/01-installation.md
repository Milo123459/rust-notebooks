# Installation

This is the first step in becoming a Rustacean. Installing is easy, fast, and efficient!

Firstly, lets go to [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) - download and run the installer.

Then, go to the terminal and type

```
rustup toolchain add stable
```

Congrats, rust is installed. See how easy that was?

If you need to update, type 
```
rustup update
```

Seriously, I'm not joking, it is that easy!
